            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we were asked to used our mobile devices for any casual browsing for 24 hours. I did not do this. However, I did do this for a few minutes to see which websites were compatible and vice versa.  </p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Yes. However, some websites don't even have a mobile version, so I have to scroll in everytime to distinguish the words.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Albeit, on some mobile versions, the links I click to go into different pages of the websites are located in other places, making it harder to find.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>As I mentionted above, I can but with more difficulty, whether it is taking time to find what I want, or zooming in constantly</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Not really.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Twitter. It seems to be very well made for mobile devices.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned that some websites don't have mobile versions, and that websites, like news websites, that need to post a lot of information, can't post as much for me to view, because they usually do one article at a time, that takes up the entire space.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
