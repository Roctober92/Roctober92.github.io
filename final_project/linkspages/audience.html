            <h1>Tourists:</h1>
                <p>Tourists will want to come to this page. It will give them a very great idea of food selection, and what to lookout for in terms of City style and cultural activities.</p>

                <p>Tourists here are defined as those who want to visit the city for vacational purposes.</p>



            <h1>International Workers</h1>
                <p> This page will service those who need to travel internationally for work, whether for long-term of temporary stay. This page will give them the idea of lifestyle, food selection, and how to become more like the people there.</p>



            <h1>Future Missionaries</h1>
                <p>This page is coming from a return missionary. I know everything a new missionary needs to know ahead of time before serving. What food to expect, how to become more like the people, how to prepare lingually, and understanding more the wonderful people they are going to serve.</p>
