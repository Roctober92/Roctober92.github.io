            <h1>Tourists:</h1>
                <p>Tourists will want to come to this page. It will give them a very great idea of food selection, and what to lookout for in terms of City style and cultural activities.</p>

                <p>Tourists here are defined as those who want to visit the city for vacational purposes.</p>



            <h1>International Workers</h1>
                <p> This page will service those who need to travel internationally for work, whether for long-term of temporary stay. This page will give them the idea of lifestyle, food selection, and how to become more like the people there.</p>



            <h1>Future Missionaries</h1>
                <p>This page is coming from a return missionary. I know everything a new missionary needs to know ahead of time before serving. What food to expect, how to become more like the people, how to prepare lingually, and understanding more the wonderful people they are going to serve.</p>


            <h1><a href="https://wireframe.cc/uDjTPe">Large Wireframe</a></h1>
            <h1><a href="https://wireframe.cc/NzjFXB">Small Wireframe</a></h1>
            <p>This will be for my Food page, accessed by the food link.</p>


            <h1>Persona(The perfect viewer)</h1>
            <p>Future Elder Thomas Hill, 19, resident of Meza, AZ, graduated high school 6 months ago, and after working for a couple of months to help pay for his mission, was referred to this website from his stake President as a resource to help him learn more about the culture of his mission. He goes on not expecting to spend more than 10 minutes, but to get a good idea of what he'll experience. We wants more pictures, and less words. </p>


            <h1>Style Guide</h1>
            <p>Colors: The colors of the Argentine flag (light blue, yellow, white, and black)</p>
            <p>Layout Style: Words used are short descriptions, and labels for pictures. Every page should have large heading up top, maybe a short description of the page below, and then photos and words. Photos should be symmetrical, maybe 2-4 per row, with words incorporated as described above. </p>
            <p>Website Skeleton: A main page, branches into 5 links for the 5 topics. The each topic should have brief information, then some branch out into subtopics, the topics with their own pages.</p>

            <div class="flag">
                <P>Colors</P>
            </div>

            <h1>JSON Usage</h1>
            <p>Speech Page: Used 70 lines of JavaScript and 60 lines of JSON to populate the left and right tables of Words and Phrases.</p>
