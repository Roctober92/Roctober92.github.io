                    <li><strong>What: </strong>Popular way of travel, with <a href="http://www.xcolectivo.com.ar/colectivo/" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of routes in and out of the city. Usually seat 30-50 people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where: </strong>Stops are every 2 blocks. Almost every city street houses a 'colectivo' route.</li>
                    <li><strong>When: </strong>Colectivos run all day and night. More frequently during the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>How: </strong>A digital card system called <a href="http://www.thebubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sube.jpg" target="_blank">SUBE</a>. One extends their arm while on the side of the street, gets the drivers attention. When boarded, tells the driver the destination, and the driver puts the amount. The passenger then puts the SUBE card against the <a href="https://blogfindelsiglo.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/tarjeta-sube.jpg?w=700" target="_blank">digital</a> reader.</li>

                    <li><strong>What: </strong><a href="http://www.buenosaires54.com/images/mapa_tren_min.JPG" target="_blank">Several</a> lines in and out of the city. Trains are usually 100 yards long. Capital has a subway system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where: </strong>Every 15-25 blocks. It takes about 3-5 minutes between every <a href="http://media.ambito.com/diario/2017/0509/imagenes/not_882249_09_182022.jpg" target="_blank">station</a> . Almost all lines end in capital, and branch outwards, some for a couple of hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>When: </strong>Trains come every 7-15 minutes. Sometimes during high-volume hours, they come more frequently, but slower.</li>
                    <li><strong>How: </strong>By SUBE. <a href="http://cdn01.ib.infobae.com/adjuntos/162/imagenes/010/731/0010731226.JPG" target="blank">Cars</a> have 2 seats on each side, and wide aisles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact: </strong> During peak hours, the trains get so full that the people bulge out of the doors until the doors close. Also, salesman frequently walk down the ailes.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What: </strong>Taxi like service. The difference between the remis and the taxi seems to be that remises are more localized, found in neighborhoods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where: </strong>Everywhere. Even the smallest town might have remis service, especially since cars are more seldomely used.</li>
                    <li><strong>How: </strong>By phone or by walking up to the shop itself. You pay a base pay plus a mileage fee. </li>

                    <li><strong>Dogs: </strong>It's common to see <a href="http://438424cd093f86f0c7e0-2cd4f1b3b970cf6c05d6a60490c230b4.r88.cf2.rackcdn.com/perros_callejeros-1_43.jpg" target="_blank">vagrant</a> dogs roaming the streets. They are almost all scared and not dangerous. You can scare them off by bending down and pretending to pick up a rock, because they are accostumed to having rocks thrown at them. </li>
                    <li><strong>Drinker Danger: </strong>On corners, many times younger men will stand together drinking and smoking. Most citizens avoid walking by them. Their bands are called "patotas". </li>

                    <li><strong>Modern Style: </strong>Among all Argentine residences, the cities are the most modernized. Air conditiong, electronic doorbells, and intercom systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Street Condition: </strong>Even though the streets get quite dirty with litter and stains everyday, the cities have it cleaned by the morning rush. </li>

                    <li><strong>Safety Level: </strong>Is higher the closer one gets to a downtown area, usually around the center of cities. As one travels farther out, the streets eventually all go to dirt, and the citizens income level lowers.</li>

                    <li><strong>'Quintas', or Estates: </strong>Are popular home-types in rural Argentina.

Locally, they believe it's the <a href="http://argen-times.blogspot.com/2009/11/why-argentine-beef-is-best-in-world.html" target="_blank">best</a> in the world! They attribute it to the flat, fertile plains that don't demand the cattle to exert strength, which would roughen the beef.</li>
