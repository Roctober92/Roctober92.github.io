                            <li>At midnight, several people set off fireworks. The scene is marvelous, making the sky usually bright, loud, and colorful.</li>
                            <li>Instead of Santa Claus bringing presents, they have the 3 wiseman bring gifts. This happens usually a few weeks after Christmas.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Alfajores: The delicious cookie/cupcake like dessert that's pictured above. There are sold at almost every corner store. They can be homemade, sold in bakeries, or commercialized.</li>

                            <li>Mopping the front walkway: In order to clean the sidewalk that connect to the front door, a solution of water and bleach is usually poured out on the cement. Then, it is dispersed by either a bathroom "squeegie", or a broom. Water and a broom!</li>
                            <li>The <a href="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/bidet-comeback-1.jpg" target="_blank">Bidet</a> (Butt cleaning machine): After using the restroom, most bathroom have a bidet right next to it. Using it makes sense: when we are dirty, instead of wiping ourselves down with wipes to clean ourselves, we wash ourselves with water. The same applies for the bathroom!</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>First Division Soccer: This is Argentina's top league, and has 30 teams. Whenever you meet someone new, they often as you, "Which team do you root for?"</li>
                            <li>River vs. Boca (pictured above): This is their biggest rivalry, and both teams have the city in an uproar. When one wins, you'll see fireworks, and hear celibration long into the night.</li>
