Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail... But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>

                <p id="personal">What does it mean to pray with all of the enery of our hearts? I've experienced being "filled with his love" before, and it is marvelous. When your thoughts are consumed with meaningful thoughts of helping others, passionate about their welfare, consuming priority even above other normal activites and functions.<br><br>It takes effort to think positively about others, ignoring all negative thoughts, and praying for them, and for charity. But being willing is the key. And of course it lays at the root for all your do and think about, but it sets all of your thoughts and desires in a straight and narrow course. Wouldn't it be nice to be free of envy, anger, negatism, and fear?</p>
