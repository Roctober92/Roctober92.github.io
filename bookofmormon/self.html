                <p id="bottom1">Especially in the case of Nephi above, God wants us to become our own problem solvers in most cases. Isn't the deepest form of learning out of necessity? Maybe our mortality is made to be the perfect place where problems are designly presented to us, and our progression comes from how we choose to solution or ignore the problems.<br><br>We choose here and now who we want to become. And we become by action, our actions directed by our desires.<br><br>I get filled with the spirit reading about Moroni's innovation and vision. Clearly, acting on a divine purpose is a great way to learn, as well as feel satisfaction. If we want, we create. The law of the harvest is to teach us satisfaction and self-reliance. </p>
