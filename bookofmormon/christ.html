And among the partial truths and falsehoods out there, the Book of Mormon gives us a clear identity and character for him.<br><br>The Son of God, annointed to be the mediator for all men who come upon the Earth. He has pure intentions. His character is described in Moroni 7, and love in 3 Nephi 17, when he personifies his compassion. He loves his people, as shown by his voiced motives in 3 Nephi 9-10. He talks to all people upon all isles of the sea, and does what the Father would do if we lived upon the Earth.<br><br>He is found by following Him. He promises that if we do as He did, we will become as He is. And that is pure joy and truth.</p>
