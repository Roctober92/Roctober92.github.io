                <p id="abajo">As it says in Abraham: "...Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy of agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power". Agency is key on God's plan. How are we to progress if we don't choose? Elder Bednar once said that the best teachers didn't give him the answers, but led him in a way so that he could find his own answers. Simply we choose our destiny, we choose who we become. There is no other way. God lets us become who we want, regardless of what he wants. He won't control us, like Satan wants, because that is opposite of progression's natural laws.</p>
