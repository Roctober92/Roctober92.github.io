This is our time to perform our labors, to show unto God we do care. He is giving us this time to develop Christlike attributes, to make a difference in the lives of people, enrich our testimonies, develop talents, and enjoy.<br><br> I was once told in a blessing that this life is the perfect time for me to make and learn from mistakes. That is its design. I love that if we aren't sure about somethings in this life, we can try it out a little, and know by experience it's value.</p>
