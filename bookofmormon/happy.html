                <p id="abajo">Happiness is the object of our design, and I believe the drive behind all behavior. These three passages highlight brilliantly three dimensions of being happy. It involves having purposeful work, obeying God's commandments (which is avoiding pitfalls), and having Godly attributes one towards another.<br><br> The happiest I've been in my life are in times where I had a focus on others. I was constantly thinking what to do next to help them. In other times, I would be involved in a purposeful cause, whether in study or in work. And not just any work makes me happy, but the kind that has a positive affect on other people, and involves my critical thinking.<br><br> God has a fulness of joy. I think it comprises being self-reliant, having good purposes in everything, extending talents, and thinking of other as yourself. Happiness is had despite of situation. </p>
