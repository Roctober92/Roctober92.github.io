We have fully utilized the information given online for both data and photo purposes. <br><br> When I was serving a full-time 2-year mission in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I would often receive images of our beloved home thanks to your webcam. We are very, very thankful.</p></div>

                <div class="box" id="one"><p>We also use the images taken from yours (and other Roxborough webcams aka the chatfield farms east one) to relay to family members in other parts of the world how Roxborough is faring. <br><br> The fact that we can access weather information for around our house from a neighbor is an astounding concept. And we thank you sincerely for providing such the service.</p></div>
                <div class="box"><p>Your information regarding wind speed, precipitation, and temperature aids me in my climate research. I have analyzed local and large-scale global weather patterns, intrigued by local sub-climates. <br><br> It aids me because the visuals I can create for year periods represent well our climate, and I can compare it with those of other local areas to explain geographical differences.</p>
