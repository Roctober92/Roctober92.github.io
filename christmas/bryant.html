                        <p>If you were wondering, I created these templates last year for Christmas, and thought I would use it again for you haha. You can actually view this on a webpage if you go to roctober92.github.io/christmas/bryant.html<br><br>We've had some great times, man! Thanks for being a friend all these years, and I think as we have made similar life choices up until this point, it has only led us to connect even further.<br><br>I'm not sure at this point exactly where you are going now that you are graduated, but I am excited and have faith in that you will rock it, especially since you seem have found something you love in life, and are pursuiting it vigorously. <br><br>I'm not sure what the details are in my life either, but I like where I am going, and will continue to do the best I can, and I'm sure you'll do the same, and I'm sure as time goes on we'll have more and more reason to rejoice! I will always be there for you!<br><br>Just as the scripture I have attached says, I love how you have chosen to put Christ as a center in your life. That is the most important for me. Te quiero amigo, y te espero Feliz Navidad, prospero año y felicidad! <br><br><i>PS: Enjoy this funny pic of amish girls on bikes I found while on Google Maps randomely in New England one day. I was going to put one up of us, but had forgotten I placed this here as my webpage templace placeholder haha.</i> </p>
