I recognize that I didn't have a lot of time to actually talk with both of you during the mission, but all the same I could feel your love and support. Every moment I did have along with you two, or individually, I could feel your concern and attention. <br><br>The counsels you have given: the first SOL about moving forward with faith, you family counsels about movie ratings, having pairs when using the computer, about working with sister missionaries, among many others, I have taken to heart, and considered how to implement them in my life. It shows a depth of wisdom when conducting one's life.</li>

                        <li>I am astounded how far my life's trajectory has changed since serving those 2 years in Buenos Aires. </li>
                        <li>Life is much more significant when we are involved in a purpose to serve others</li>
                        <li>How we decide to act and think determines our experience. We make it happy or sad</li>
                        <li>Thinking of yourself as the servant blesses one with the ability to have self confidence and simplicity</li>
                        <li>Love for one another is the greatest motivator and feeling I have ever felt</li>
                        <li>Listening to one another is a key to loving someone. Also to teaching.</li>
                        <li>The greatest form of teaching may be not telling someone something, but letting them reason it out for themselves, through wise guiding.</li>

                        Mission Impressions
                    </h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While on the mission, I had a lot of thoughts about its pros and cons, and how it could be improved.</li>
                        <li>I was never sure if it was okay or not to eat dinner. The white handbook said we would get an hour, but the culture of the mission seemed to be to skip it - which caused me great adjustment and anguish upon mission arrival, and furthur mental confusion later on in my mission. Was I being disobedient if we did? I think now they might have clarified it more.</li>
                        <li>Something that has surprised me looking back retrospectively on the mission is how much I enjoyed the little things, and that the little things had great power in making it a joyful and lasting experience. These would be: that one lesson where the investigator clearly understood and we rejoiced together, the surprise dinner from a member visit, the Monday tradition of buying facturas before writing our parents, feeling the fall air and smelling the pine trees while seeing the sunset in Chivilcoy, etc. These were great moments! Ones that bring me and gratitude towards God.</li>
                        <li>I'm extremely grateful that the Johnson's came in with a vigor to install a culture of cleaning. Not that I was dirty beforehand, but what it did for me (and hopefully others) was solidify my testimony that the spirit is felt in clean places. After my mission, I was able to help clean the temple with my Mom during the 2 week closure, and was astounded to see that they clean everything! Even if it is already clean. But this shows the detail needed to consecrate a holy place to the Lord. I now try to do the same for my apartment.</li>
