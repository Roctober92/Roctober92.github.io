I recognize that I didn't have a lot of time to actually talk with both of you during the mission, but all the same I could feel your love and support. Every moment I did have along with you two, or individually, I could feel your concern and attention. <br><br>The counsels you have given: the first SOL about moving forward with faith, you family counsels about movie ratings, having pairs when using the computer, about working with sister missionaries, among many others, I have taken to heart, and considered how to implement them in my life. It shows a depth of wisdom when conducting one's life.</li>

                        <li>I am astounded how far my life's trajectory has since serving those 2 years in Buenos Aires. </li>
                        <li>Life is much more significant when we are involved in a purpose to serve others</li>
                        <li>How we decide to act and think determines our experience. We make it happy or sad</li>
                        <li>Thinking of yourself as the servant blesses one with the ability to have self confidence and simplicity</li>
                        <li>Love for one another is the greatest motivator and feeling I have ever felt</li>
                        <li>Listening to one another is a key to loving someone. Also to teaching.</li>
                        <li>The greatest form of teaching may be not telling someone something, but letting them reason it out for themselves, through wise guiding.</li>

                        Mission Impressions
                    </h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While on the mission, I had a lot of thoughts about its pros and cons, and how it could be improved.</li>
                        <li>I was never sure if it was okay or not to eat dinner. The white handbook said we would get an hour, but the culture of the mission seemed to be to skip it - which caused me great adjustment and anguish upon mission arrival, and furthur mental confusion later on in my mission. Was I being disobedient if we did? Was that a thing? Being disobedient by eating dinner? Obviously it was announced later on that 15-45 minute snack was strongly suggested, but the fact that such an essential thing was neglected because cultural fear seems concerning.</li>
